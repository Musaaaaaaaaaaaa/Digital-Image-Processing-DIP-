# 🖼️ Digital Image Processing (DIP) System

A Python-based image enhancement and analysis system leveraging **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to improve image quality, detect edges, and reduce noise in low-resolution images.  
The system applies advanced **contrast enhancement**, **thresholding**, and **filtering algorithms** for better visual clarity and precision.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Image Enhancement** — preprocesses and sharpens images for improved quality.  
- **Edge Detection & Segmentation** — isolates key image features using OpenCV techniques.  
- **Adaptive Contrast Algorithms** — dynamically adjusts brightness and clarity.  
- **Noise Reduction** — filters out unwanted background patterns for clean output.  
- **Real-Time Analysis Dashboard** — visualizes performance and image comparisons.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The system loads an input image.  
2. Applies preprocessing (resizing, grayscale conversion, filtering).  
3. Uses OpenCV algorithms to detect edges and enhance contrast.  
4. Displays original and processed outputs using Matplotlib for visual comparison.
